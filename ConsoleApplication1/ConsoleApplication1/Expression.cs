//// Using Test Driven Development, create an Expression class that will break down a simple 2-term calculator expression.

// Prove you can extract the terms of the expression.
// Prove you can extract the operation embedded in the expression.
// Ensure you have examples of GOOD and BAD input and have your Expression class throw an exception when there's an error.
//Hints

//Your expression should work with and without spaces. (i.e.both 2+1 and 2 + 1 should work)
//The use of Regular Expressions is not required.
//GOOD input example: 1+2
//BAD input example +2
//You do not need to handle the cases of usage of parenthesis or expressions with more than 2 terms.
