//Chunk 2 - Evaluting Simple Expressions

//Goal

//Using Test Driven Development, create another class (the name is up to you, but must be separate from the class int he first Chuch) that can evaluate a simple 2-term calculator expression, returning the appropriate answer.

//Prove your class can execute the correct operation of a GOOD expression. (If you already have classes for the various math operations, this is easy).
//Prove your class can handle a BAD expression.
//FAQs/Hints

//Should my Evaluate class print something to the Console? No
